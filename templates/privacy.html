                         <div>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the

                         <div><strong>5. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</strong></div>
                         <div><strong><em>In Short:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>We aim to protect your personal information

                         <div>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security
                          measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However,
                          despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over
                          the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we
                          cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties
                          will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your
                          information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission
                          of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access
                          the Services within a secure environment.</div>
                         <div><strong>6. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</strong></div>
                         <div><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;We do not knowingly collect data from or

                         <div>We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By
                          using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or
                          guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent&rsquo;s use of the Services. If
                          we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we
                          will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our
                          records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18,
                          please contact us at contact@finalharvest.app.</div>

                         <div>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a
                          Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not
                          to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no
                          uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized.
                          As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that
                          automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online
                          tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice
                          in a revised version of this privacy notice.</div>
                         <div><strong>9. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</strong></div>
